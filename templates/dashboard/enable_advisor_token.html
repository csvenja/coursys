<p>
    Activating the advisor notes API may cause security concerns. Please note that:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		A secret token will be generated for your account that allows advising notes to be added via an external API that <strong>bypasses normal authentication</strong>. It is your responsibility to keep this token private.
	</li>
    <li>
        The generated token will contain a long string of random characters that would be essentially impossible to guess.
    </li>
    <li>
        Your token can be deactivated or changed any any time.
    </li>
</ul>
